# Unity Value Investor Presentation

I gave a Unity investment presentation with a game built in Unity.

Before you give me too much credit, 99% of the content here comes from Unity's [Platformer Microgame][] tutorial project.

I just put my slides into billboards in the game. ;-)

The first few slides are easy to get to.  But to access the last few slides the player needs to enter a cheat code.
(HINT: It is the letter `x` on the keyboard)

Or you can just browse the [üìÅSlides folder](./Assets/Slides) under game Assets.

The content of the slides is pretty terse as I delivered most of the info orally. If you'd like me to give this presentation to your group let me know.

## Development Environment
